2.  **Connect to Syllabus:** Always link the current affair to the relevant UPSC syllabus paper and topic. For instance, the AMR 2.0 plan directly relates to the Health section in GS Paper II.
3.  **Contextualize:** Understand the background. For the Finance Commission, know its constitutional basis and previous recommendations. For international deals, understand the geopolitical context.
4.  **Think Critically:** For policy-related news (like PMFBY or AI courses), consider its potential impact, challenges, and alternative approaches.
5.  **Practice Answer Writing:** Use these points to practice answer writing for both Prelims (MCQ based) and Mains (Descriptive). For example, draft an answer on "India's efforts to combat Antimicrobial Resistance."
6.  **PDFs and Notes:** The website mentions PDF resources. Download and review them. Create your own concise notes for revision.
